Our modern recycling centre was built using state-of-art technology to ensure the maximum recovery of recyclables. The MRF can process up to 30 tonnes per hour - that is equivalent to four full recycling trucks.

The Recycling Centre accepts ‘mixed recycling’ (i.e. mixed plastic and cardboard containers, cans and bottles).

That makes recycling easier for everyone, as recyclables don’t need to be separated for collection.

Collection trucks bring recyclables to our recycling centre in Bibra Lake, 20km south of the Perth CBD. The recyclables are unloaded into an area called the “tipping floor”.

From the tipping floor, recycling is placed onto a conveyor belt to commence processing. Recycling is then sorted by MRF machinery or by hand into “material streams” of:",charity_bin_dir_ltg,https://www.rubbishtips.com.au/perth/suez-bibra-lake-resource-recovery-park-bibra-lake-transfer-station/,Transfer Station,Perth,Construction Material|Metals|Paper &amp; Cardboard|Rubber,suez-bibra-lake-resource-recovery-park-bibra-lake-transfer-station,perth/suez-bibra-lake-resource-recovery-park-bibra-lake-transfer-station,location_address,"65 Howson Way, Bibra Lake WA 6163, Australia",Howson Way,,,Western Australia,6163,AU,-32.110156,115.806054
