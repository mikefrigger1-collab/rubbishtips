These are Port Latta in the North West and Dulverton in the North. In the south the Hobart City Council site at McRobies Gully can take limited Controlled Waste such as some medical waste and quarantine waste. In the north, the Launceston City Council at Remount Road can take small and limited quantities of Controlled Waste.\r\n\r\nIt is always wise to contact the <a href=\"http://epa.tas.gov.au/pages/Contact-Us.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Waste Management Officers</a> at the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment to ask their advise before you dispose of any Controlled Waste or if you are unsure if your waste is considered 'Controlled Waste' or not...."
